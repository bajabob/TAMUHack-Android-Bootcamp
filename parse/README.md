# Using Parse
There are a few things you will need to do in order to set up Parse to work with your environment.

## Create an Account & App
Go to parse.com and create a new account. After creating an account, create a new application for Android.

## Get your Keys
On parse.com in your application, find the two key's you'll need to connect your app to parse. In this codebase the keys are specified in `BootcampApplication.java`

## Create your two Parse Tables
You will need to create two tables to hold your app's data. This is found in `your parse application/core`. On the left bar you should see an `Import` button. Import the two JSON files, `User.json` and `Messages.json`.

## Compile the Android Application!
